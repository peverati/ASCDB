## Evaluation

In this folder, we collected the reference energies for the datapoints in ASCDB. There are four files, with the first three differing only in the units for the reference energies:

* **ASCDB_kJ.csv**: This file contains information about the datapoints' names, the reference energies in kJ/mol, the geometries files needed for the calculations (from the Geometries folder), and the stoichiometric coefficients for the reaction. 

* **ASCDB_kcal.csv**: This file contains information about the datapoints' names, the reference energies in kcal/mol, the geometries files needed for the calculations (from the Geometries folder), and the stoichiometric coefficients for the reaction.

* **ASCDB_Eh.csv**: This file contains information about the datapoints' names, the reference energies in Hartrees, the geometries files needed for the calculations (from the Geometries folder), and the stoichiometric coefficients for the reaction.

* **ASCDB_Evaluation.xlsx**: This file is included as Supporting Information of the [original article](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/cp/c9cp03211h#!divAbstract). It represents a useful tool to calculate the mean unsigned error (MUE), the mean signed error, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the whole database and its subsets. If needed, additional sheets are provided to calculate the MUE and RMSE for the parent databases through regression formulas. More details can be found in the original publication.
